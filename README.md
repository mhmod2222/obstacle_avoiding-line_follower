# obstacle_avoiding-line_follower
In this project, an obstacle avoidance robot with line following function is used to follow a black colored path whilst avoiding obstacles in its way. The main components of such a robot are the microcontroller, which is the brain of the robot, Infrared Sensor, which helps it to distinguish between white and black colored path, and ultrasonic sensor to measure distance to the nearest obstacle.
